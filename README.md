    My small but growing collection of scripts
  </p>
</div>

This project is basically a small collection of scripts which I frequently use. I developed them using [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (Arch-based distro), so its possible that some scripts, like the linux configuration won't work in other distros (obviously).

## Installation

Just clone it and be happy.

## To Do

- [ ] Add script to download and setup Flutter
- [ ] Add script to create MongoDB container
- [ ] Add script to create Postgres container
- [ ] Implement Linux installation script for Debian-based distros
