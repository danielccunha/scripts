    My small but growing collection of scripts

## :computer: Project

This project is basically a small collection of scripts which I frequently use. I developed them using [Manjaro](https://manjaro.org/) (Arch-based distro), so its possible that some scripts, like the linux configuration won't work in other distros (obviously).

## :fire: Usage

Just clone it and be happy.

## :heavy_check_mark: To Do

- [ ] Add script to download and setup Flutter
- [ ] Add script to create MongoDB container
- [ ] Add script to create Postgres container
- [ ] Implement Linux installation script for Debian-based distros
