# Linux Configuration

Currently I'm a Manjaro user, so this scripts are focused on setting up Manjaro environments. Ideally it should work with any operating system, but for now it's what we got.

## Setting up

Also in the config folder, there is a **vscode** folder. There you'll find pretty self explanatory files for configuring Visual Studio Code.

It's just necessary in case you are going to use it. Add your default extensions, keybindings and user settings, and the script will add them automatically to Visual Studio Code.

Last but not least, in the end of the scripts you'll find a call to a function called **install_packages**. I've already added a couple of packages I use. Fell free to add your own packages.

## Installing

After finished setting up, just run the script with **./system.sh** and be happy.
